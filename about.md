Here I share things that I have written -- many in response to jobs that I have held (in or around ... farm labor, tourism, creative writing, education, bioethics, and library publishing) or in response to texts that I read. I do not stand by anything that I have written ... except to say, yes, I wrote that. (I am new to Jekyll and to GitHub. Tips and suggestions welcomed. -- J.O., July 2017.)

I also maintain the following online profiles:

* a professional landing page at my place of work: [IUPUI University Library Center for Digital Scholarship](http://www.ulib.iupui.edu/digitalscholarship/people/jereodell)
* an ORCID profile for my scholarly publications: [orcid.org/0000-0001-5455-1471](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5455-1471)
* an ImpactStory profile that leverages my ORCID: [https://impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-5455-1471](https://impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-5455-1471)
* a GoogleScholar profile for tracking citations to my works: [V19qkaEAAAA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V19qkaEAAAAJ)
* a LinkedIN account that I find little use for: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jereodell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jereodell)
* and a Twitter feed [https://twitter.com/jaireeo](https://twitter.com/jaireeo).

I have also blogged on Wordpress.com and (once upon a time) Blogger. And I've created accounts on other sites, now poorly maintained.

At some point I will begin to keep my C.V. live here on this Jekyll GitHub Pages site.
