What did I ever want to do? Something of artistry & daily. I landed on literature and poetry in college. To write better poetry I learned to read — to read slowly and deeply. And then I learned much about disparate subjects of the ordinary and the marvelous. Theology of some kinds. Philosophy of some kinds. The tactile & visual arts of some kinds. The writings of many, many kinds. And some languages, loosely — but not well enough to find a toilet. And all that not enough. But I’m grateful for it all the same.

And to earn my keep. Librarianship: some cataloguing, some ontologies, some strategies, but largley professional inculturalization. Most usefully, HTML & CSS — enough to make some things.

And to keep earning my keep … but more so to make a difference in how I earn my keep & to feel good about earning it: bits and pieces of open science. From citation analysis in Excel, to stats on the same in SPSS, to (now) data crunching in R.

And this too. A little writing poorly planned & versioned here and there and shared here and there. Markdown, Jekyll, and GitHub and things.

Part satisfaction. Part necessity. Part futility. Large part futility. Learning one more way to serve up a piece of writing feels at times like manipulating fonts in my first runs with a word processor. A few minutes in you realize that it’s the same composition with or without the ease of graphical editing. And, yet.
